# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of the project
Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results:

There are more drivers and rides in urban cities, given to this, the amount of total fares is bigger in urban cities compared to rural cities. However, the average dare per ride and average fare per driver is better in rural cities. For this reason it is possible to increase the number of drivers in rural cities.

## Summary:


Three business recommendations to the CEO:

1. Increase the number of drivers in rural cities
2. Review the number of drivers in urban cities (probably they are to many)
3. Review if all the urban drivers are working a complete journey (the number of driver exceed the numbers of rides)
